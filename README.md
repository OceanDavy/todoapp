NOTE: I'll fix the folder structure later, you can check the code either way if you want to see what I did to make it work. :) 

The purpose of this project was to practice and get more comfortable when it comes to building Full-Stack Websites.
I used React, Node, Express and PostgreSQL to built this, it might be the most simple project in the world but it is a good start and great way to put your first step in this whole area of full stack development.

the actions in this app is pretty simple: Add new Tasks, Delete Tasks, Look all your created tasks and Edit your existing tasks.
